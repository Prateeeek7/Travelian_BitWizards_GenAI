# travel.py - AI Agent System for Travel Planning
# ----------------------------------------------
#
# This module implements a sophisticated multi-agent system for travel planning
# with a specific focus on Indian travel destinations and experiences.
#
# ARCHITECTURE:
# The system uses a collection of specialized AI agents, each responsible for
# a different aspect of travel planning:
#
# 1. Destination Research Agent - Researches destinations based on user preferences
# 2. Accommodation Agent - Suggests suitable accommodations meeting budget and preference constraints
# 3. Transportation Agent - Plans optimal transportation between locations
# 4. Activities Agent - Curates personalized activities based on interests
# 5. Dining Agent - Recommends dining experiences showcasing local cuisine
# 6. Itinerary Agent - Compiles all recommendations into a cohesive day-by-day plan
# 7. Chatbot Agent - Provides conversational responses to travel queries
#
# Each agent is powered by Google's Generative AI (Gemini) and is specialized through
# careful system prompting that defines its role, goals, and expected outputs.
#
# WORKFLOW:
# 1. User submits travel preferences
# 2. Each agent processes the information in sequence
# 3. Final itinerary is compiled from all agent outputs
# 4. Results are presented to the user as a complete travel plan
#
# PRIMARY FUNCTIONS:
# - run_task(): Core function to execute a specific agent task
# - generate_travel_itinerary(): Orchestrates the full planning process
# - save_itinerary_to_file(): Saves the generated itinerary for the user
#
# Created by TechMatrix Solvers for IIITDMJ HackByte3.0
